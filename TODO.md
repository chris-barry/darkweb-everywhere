# TODO
Just a simple TODO list of possible ideas, bugfixes, etc. 

## Possible Features
* Tails support. 
  * Maybe a prompt in the script asking the user if they are using Tails or not is the least painful way of doing this. I (colin) will do some testing over my upcoming break to see if one can modify Tails' HTTPS Everywhere rules without needing the user to put in a password.
* Windows installer?

## Bugs
* None so far!
